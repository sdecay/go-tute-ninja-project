### Fooling With Go

After React and Javascript hell (pretty enjoyable hell, but still hell), I decided to learn 
Go because it's a real programming language.

Just doing a tutorial or two then grabbing some books.  Really liking it so far, aside from
some questionable syntax and _iota_, which nobody should ever use ever.

Been forever since I've learned a compiled language and it's awesome.

Sometimes I like the curly braces on their own line and semicolons are cool as hell but we 
can't have everything. üòÅ
